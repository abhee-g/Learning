How To Generate Certificate and Import In To Certificate Manager In AWS

Certificates are digital documents used to establish the identity of an entity, such as a website, server, or individual. They are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) and serve as a way to ensure the authenticity and security of the entity. Certificates are commonly used to enable secure communication over the internet, such as with HTTPS.

A certificate contains the following information:

Public Key: The public key used for encrypting data and establishing secure connections.
Identity Information: Information about the entity, such as its name and domain.
Digital Signature: A signature created by the Certificate Authority to validate the authenticity of the certificate.

Please  follow the below steps to generate the Certificate and import into ACM
============================================================
First clone the easy-rasa repository
         git clone https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa.git
Then Navigate to the the easyrsa3 folder
         cd easy-rasa/easyrsa3
Next we need to initialize new PKI (Public Key infrastructure)
        ./easyrsa init-pki
Once PKI initialized we need to build our certificate Authority
       ./easyrsa build-ca nopass
Then we need to create out server certificate
      ./easyrsa build-server-full clientvpndemo.com nopass
Then we need to create our client certificate
     ./easyrsa build-client-full Satyajit.clientvpndemo.com nopass


To make it easier  Letâ€™s copy all the certificate to one place
Create a Directory and keep all the certificates on that directoy
       mkdir act
cp  pki/ca.crt acm
cp pki/issued/clientvpndemo.com.crt acm
cp pki/issued/satyajit.clientvpndemo.com.crt acm
cp pki/private/clientvpndemo.com.key acm
cp pki/private/satyajit.clientvpndemo.com.key acm

Importing Certificate to AWS using CLI
=================================
aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb:///Users/satyajitsamantaray/easy-rsa/easyrsa3/acm/satyajit.clientvpndemo.com.crt --private-key fileb:///Users/satyajitsamantaray/easy-rsa/easyrsa3/acm/satyajit.clientvpndemo.com.key
